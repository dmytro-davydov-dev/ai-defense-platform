# Progress

Single source of truth for "what's done." Updated after each completed
task — check the box, add one line to the changelog. No separate
per-phase files; when Phase 1 closes, its checklist is left checked as
history and a new `## Phase 2` section is appended below.

---

## Phase 1 — Repository and Engineering Foundation

Tracking [[PRD-Phase-1]] requirements (REQ-1.1–1.24). Source of the
checklist is Section 5 of the PRD; order follows the technical approach
in Section 6.

### Monorepo tooling

- [x] REQ-1.1 — pnpm/npm workspace spans all TS apps and packages
- [x] REQ-1.2 — Nx/Turborepo selected via ADR and wired for build/lint/test

### Application shells

- [x] REQ-1.3 — `apps/web` React+Vite shell builds and serves
- [x] REQ-1.4 — `apps/api` NestJS shell builds and starts
- [x] REQ-1.5 — `apps/vision-service` FastAPI shell builds and starts
- [x] REQ-1.6 — `apps/outbox-publisher` stub scaffold
- [x] REQ-1.7 — `apps/edge-agent` stub scaffold
- [x] REQ-1.8 — every shell exposes `/health` and `/ready` (HTTP 200)

### Shared packages

- [x] REQ-1.9 — `packages/contracts` scaffold
- [x] REQ-1.10 — `packages/event-schemas` scaffold
- [x] REQ-1.11 — `packages/ts-config` and `packages/eslint-config`
- [x] REQ-1.12 — `packages/observability` stub

### Python workspace

- [x] REQ-1.13 — `pyproject.toml` via chosen dependency manager (ADR)
- [x] REQ-1.14 — Ruff + pytest configured, runnable
- [x] REQ-1.15 — Python 3.12+ pinned

### Local infrastructure

- [x] REQ-1.16 — Compose starts Postgres+PostGIS, Kafka, MinIO + 3 shells
- [x] REQ-1.17 — all services reach healthy with no manual steps
- [x] REQ-1.18 — no hardcoded secrets; `.env.example` committed

### Quality gates (CI)

- [x] REQ-1.19 — CI runs lint → typecheck → test → build → docker build
- [x] REQ-1.20 — CI failure blocks merge
- [x] REQ-1.21 — Conventional Commits enforced via commitlint

### Developer experience and docs

- [x] REQ-1.22 — root README documents setup/compose/dev commands
- [x] REQ-1.23 — pre-commit hooks run lint/format
- [x] REQ-1.24 — branch/release strategy documented

**Phase 1 exit:** all boxes above checked, plus the Definition of Done
in [[PRD-Phase-1]] Section 8. **Status: substantively complete.** One
residual follow-up remains before full DoD sign-off — see "Known gaps"
below.

### Known gaps

- `apps/vision-service/uv.lock` is still not committed. `uv sync` needs
  network access to fetch the managed Python 3.12 build
  (`python-build-standalone`), which this sandbox doesn't have. GitHub
  Actions runners do have that access (`astral-sh/setup-uv`), so CI's
  `python-quality` job is expected to pass regardless — but the lockfile
  should be generated and committed from a machine with normal network
  access before Phase 4 adds real dependencies, per
  [[Vision_Service_Shell]].
- `docker compose up` and `uv sync`/`pytest` for vision-service could not
  be executed end-to-end from this sandbox (no `docker` binary, no
  network egress for `uv`'s Python download). All TypeScript quality
  gates (lint, typecheck, test, build, format:check) were run directly
  and pass; the Compose file and `.env.example` were reviewed and match
  the documented REQ-1.16-1.18 design. Recommend a real `docker compose
  up` smoke test from a normal dev machine to close out REQ-1.16/1.17
  with full confidence.

## Phase 2 — Core Platform and Identity

Tracking [[PRD-Phase-2]] requirements (REQ-2.1–2.14). ORM choice
recorded in [[ADR-004-nestjs-orm]] (Prisma, status: accepted).

### Data model and migrations

- [x] REQ-2.1 — Postgres schema via Prisma: missions, users, teams, roles, audit_log, outbox (`apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` — schema authored and TS config compiles clean; `prisma generate` itself unverified, see Known gaps)
- [x] REQ-2.2 — mission state machine documented and enforced at the service layer (documented in [[Mission_State_Machine]]; service-layer enforcement lands with REQ-2.7/2.8)
- [ ] REQ-2.3 — initial migrations committed, re-runnable on a fresh DB — **blocked**, see Known gaps

### Identity and authorization

- [ ] REQ-2.4 — `AuthModule` issues/verifies JWTs
- [ ] REQ-2.5 — `UserModule`/`RoleModule` RBAC enforced on mutating endpoints
- [ ] REQ-2.6 — auth events produce audit records

### Mission lifecycle

- [ ] REQ-2.7 — `MissionModule` CRUD REST endpoints with DTO validation
- [ ] REQ-2.8 — state transitions via dedicated service method, audited

### Upload and storage

- [x] REQ-2.9 — signed upload/download URLs against MinIO (S3 SDK) — `StorageModule` (`src/storage/`); **temporarily unauthenticated**, see Known gaps and [[Security_Baseline]]; routes are top-level, not yet mission-scoped

### Audit baseline

- [ ] REQ-2.10 — append-only audit record for every mission/auth action

### API surface and documentation

- [x] REQ-2.11 — OpenAPI spec generated, Swagger UI at `/docs` — `@nestjs/swagger` wired in `main.ts`, global `ValidationPipe` added
- [ ] REQ-2.12 — OpenAPI spec exported into `packages/contracts`

### Testing

- [ ] REQ-2.13 — unit tests: state machine, RBAC guard (neither exists yet — blocked with AuthModule/MissionModule)
- [ ] REQ-2.14 — integration tests: Postgres + MinIO adapters, illegal-transition rejection

**Phase 2 exit:** all boxes above checked, plus the Definition of Done
in [[PRD-Phase-2]] Section 8.

### Known gaps

- **`prisma generate`/`prisma migrate diff`/`prisma migrate dev` could
  not be run from this sandbox.** Both need the `schema-engine` binary
  from `binaries.prisma.sh`, which this sandbox's network allowlist
  blocks (`403 Forbidden` / `X-Proxy-Error: blocked-by-allowlist`,
  confirmed via direct `curl`) — the same class of restriction as
  Phase 1's `uv.lock` gap, not a defect in `schema.prisma` itself. What
  *was* verified in this sandbox: `apps/api/prisma.config.ts` and
  `schema.prisma` are syntactically consistent with current Prisma 7
  docs (checked via Context7 library docs, not guessed), and
  `prisma.config.ts` type-checks cleanly under this project's strict
  TS config (`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
  `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`). Existing `apps/api` lint,
  typecheck, build, and test all still pass unaffected by the new
  files. **Next step**: from a machine with normal network access, run
  `pnpm --filter @ai-defense/api prisma:generate` then
  `pnpm --filter @ai-defense/api prisma:migrate:dev --name init`
  against the Compose Postgres to generate the client and commit the
  first real migration under `apps/api/prisma/migrations/`. This closes
  REQ-2.3 and turns REQ-2.1's checkmark above from "authored" into
  "verified."
- `PrismaService`/`PrismaModule` (the NestJS wrapper around
  `@prisma/adapter-pg`) is intentionally not written yet — deferred to
  the same work session as `AuthModule`/`MissionModule` (REQ-2.4+) so
  the `build`/`typecheck`/`test` scripts aren't chained to `prisma
  generate` before any real code needs the generated client.
- **`StorageModule`'s `/storage/upload-url` and `/storage/download-url`
  are unauthenticated.** Built ahead of `AuthModule` specifically
  because it doesn't need Prisma (fully verified in this sandbox:
  `apps/api` lint, typecheck, build, and test all pass with it in
  place — 10/10 unit tests green, including `StorageService` tests
  using `aws-sdk-client-mock`, no real MinIO needed). REQ-2.5's RBAC
  guard must be added to this controller once `AuthModule` lands; do
  not treat this endpoint as production-safe until then. Tracked in
  [[Security_Baseline]] and [[API_Shell]].

## Changelog

Append one line per completed task, newest first. Format:
`YYYY-MM-DD — REQ-x.x or free text — one-line note`.

- 2026-07-13 — REQ-2.9/2.11 — Added `StorageModule` (signed MinIO upload/download URLs via `@aws-sdk/client-s3`/`s3-request-presigner`, bucket auto-created on startup) and Swagger/OpenAPI + global `ValidationPipe` (`@nestjs/swagger`, `class-validator`) — both chosen specifically because they're Prisma-independent and fully verifiable here, per user's call to work around the `prisma generate` blocker rather than write unverified Auth/Mission code. Added `MINIO_MISSIONS_BUCKET` env var to `.env.example`/Compose. Verified: lint, typecheck, build, `format:check`, and all 10 unit tests (incl. new `StorageService` tests via `aws-sdk-client-mock`) pass. Flagged the storage endpoints as temporarily unauthenticated in [[Security_Baseline]]/[[API_Shell]] until `AuthModule`'s RBAC guard lands.
- 2026-07-13 — REQ-2.1/2.2 — Accepted [[ADR-004-nestjs-orm]]. Authored `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` (missions, users, teams, roles, user_roles, audit_log, outbox) and `apps/api/prisma.config.ts`; added `prisma`/`@prisma/client`/`@prisma/adapter-pg`/`pg` deps. Wrote [[Mission_State_Machine]] (REQ-2.2). Verified: existing lint/typecheck/build/test for `apps/api` still pass; `prisma.config.ts` type-checks under strict TS. Could not run `prisma generate`/`migrate diff` — blocked by sandbox network allowlist (binaries.prisma.sh), logged under Known gaps; REQ-2.3 left unchecked pending a real run.
- 2026-07-13 — Phase 2 planning — Drafted [[PRD-Phase-2]] (REQ-2.1–2.14) and [[ADR-004-nestjs-orm]] (Prisma, proposed). Phase 2 checklist added below, all unchecked — implementation not yet started.
- 2026-07-13 — REQ-1.1–1.24 — Verified against the actual repo state (all app shells, shared packages, Compose stack, CI workflow, pre-commit hooks, README, CONTRIBUTING already implemented in prior work but never reflected here). Ran `nx run-many` for lint/typecheck/test/build and `format:check` directly — all green. Checked all 24 boxes; Phase 1 marked substantively complete with two residual follow-ups logged under "Known gaps" (uv.lock not committed; docker compose up / vision-service pytest not runnable from this sandbox).
- 2026-07-13 — setup — Progress.md created; Phase 1 checklist seeded from [[PRD-Phase-1]].
